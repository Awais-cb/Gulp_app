Prerequisites:
Make sure to install gulp 4 if you are using node 12 or above


GULP:
-a toolkit to build js applications
-installed with npm
-takes care of time consuming repetitive tasks
-many plugins available for many tasks

COMMON tasks it does:
-Minifying code
-Files merging(js or css) into one so that application go faster
-Cache busing(letting browser know if there is a new version of cached file)
-Testing liniting debugging
(linting is the process of running a program that will analyse code for potential errors)
-Dev server(for running code on devlopment server)


How GULP works:
-built on top of node streams(a continues flow of data that can be manipulated asynchronously)
https://www.sitepoint.com/basics-node-js-streams/

-uses piping or chaining (getting the output from previous process and passing it to next one) read about '.pipe()' function

How use GULP:
we don't use gulp in production env so we have to install gulp as dev dependency

-install gulp globally
npm install -g gulp-cli

-install gulp locally in project
npm install --save-dev gulp


-create src dir for the dev src and dist for production src
-to define tasks for gulp to do create gulpfile.js in you project and define tasks

-installing image optimizer plugin for gulp
npm install --save-dev gulp-imagemin

-installing js/css minifier
npm install --save-dev gulp-uglify
